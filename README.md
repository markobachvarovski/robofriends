# robofriends
This is a small project done with React. It served as a purpose for me to learn React.
The Cards are each a user/robot that connects to an external API to generate the pictures. Each robot has a name and email also generated from another external API.
There's basic components such as a search and scroll for the purpose of learning how to work with components.
