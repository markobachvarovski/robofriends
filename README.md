# Robofriends 

This is a simple website built with React

## Usage
The user is able to scroll through the robots and use the search bar on top to select a specific user

## How it works
You might be wondering why the names appear so random. The actual names are taken from a JSON placeholder website at https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users. \
Those same names are again passed to https://robohash.org/name which generates a random image of a robot based on the name of the user. The cards are all created in React, as well as the search bar and the scroll bar.\
This was a really basic project that I used to teach myself the power of React.
